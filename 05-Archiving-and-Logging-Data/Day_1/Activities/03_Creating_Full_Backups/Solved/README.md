## Solution Guide: Creating Full Backups with `tar`

The goal of this activity was to create a *full backup* of the `epscript` directories and files, including file permissions, owner, size of file, and date and time. We verified the archive for errors after writing it, and the output from the command was saved to a text file.

The main steps of this activity were:

- Creating the name of the `tar` archive using the YYYMMDD ISO 8601 standard.

- Creating a *full backup* using the `tar` create option.

- Printing the *full listing* for each file, including the name, file permissions, and owner information. 

- Verifying the archive *after it was written* to check for errors.

- Creating a *file* of the output of the `tar` command for later review by the SysOps team.

Completing these steps will ensure that our archive has the correct data, no errors, and can be used in the event of a malware attack to restore the E-Prescription Treatment system.

1. First, we move to the `~/Documents/epscript` directory and list the directories and files located there.

   - `cd ~/Documents/epscript`  

   - `ls -l`

- Output will look similar to below: 

  ```
  drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:02   doctors
  drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:02   patients
  drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:00   treatments
  ```  

2. List the contents of the `doctor` directory and display the contents, which are `.csv` files.

   - `cd doctors`  

   - `ls -l`

- Output should read: 
  ```
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor10.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:12   doctor1.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:13   doctor2.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor3.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor4.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor5.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor6.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor7.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor8.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor9.csv
  -rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   13:22   doctor.csv
  ```

- List the contents of the `patient` and `treatment` directories and display the contents, which are also `.csv` files.

   - `cd patients; ls- l`  

   - `cd treatments; ls -l`

3. The archive filename is created using the ISO 8601 standard.

    - Using the standard format of `[YYYMMDD][filename].tar`, our archive filename is: `20190505epscript.tar`.

        - [ISO](<https://www.iso.org/home.html>) stands for International Organization for Standards. It publishes international standards such as the [ISO/IEC 27032:2012](<https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27032.html>) which is a standard for internet security issues.

        - Remember, [ISO 8601 for filenames](<https://wadegibson.com/why-you-should-use-the-iso-date-format/>) is important because:

            - The naming convention is recognized internationally.  
        
            - Files prefixed with an ISO date will automatically sort *oldest to newest* under the default alphabetical sort.

4. The syntax for the command is: 

    `tar [option(s)] [archive_filename] [objects_to_archive]`

    First, ensure your in the documents directory by running:

    `cd ../`
    
    Then we run the following command:

    `tar cvvWf 20190505epscript.tar epscript/ > 20190505epscript.txt`

    - Syntax breakdown:

      - `tar` is the name of the command.

      - `c` is the option to **create** the archive.

      - `vv` is the **very verbose** or _verbosity level 2_ option to print the full file specification for each file in the archive.  

      - `W` is the option that will verify the archive after writing it.

      - `f` specifies the **filename** for our archive.

      -  `20190505epscript.tar` is the archive filename that we created following the ISO 8601 guidelines.

      - `epscript/*` is the directory that contains all of the files to archive. We use the asterisk `*` wildcard to denote that we want _everything_ in this directory and all of its subdirectories.

      - `> 20190505epscript.txt` saves the output of the command to the the `20190505epscript.txt` text file.

5. The output of the `tar` command in the `20190505epscript.txt` file:

    - Run `cat 20190505epscript.txt | less`

      - NOTE 1: The rest of the archive follows with the "doctor" and "patient" directories and files.

      ```
      drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:11   epscript
      drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment
      -rw-r--r--  sysadmin/sysadmin   192273  2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment/treatments10.csv
      ...
      ...
      ```


    - Run `cat 20190505epscript.txt`

      - NOTE 2: Next follow the lines that "verify" writing the files in the archive after using the "W" option.

      ```
      Verify drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:11   epscript
      Verify drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:11   epscript/treatment
      Verify -rw-r--r--  sysadmin/sysadmin   192273  2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment/treatments10.csv

      ```
